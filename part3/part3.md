# Part 3

### 1.What is the bug?
The datatype of num1 and num2 are string. So the + operation will concatenate two strings together and return the result of the new concatenated string. That is why the variable result will store "12" if we input 1 and 2 in the webpage.

### 2.How to fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix
When we calculate result = num1 + num2, we can first convert the datatype of num1 and num2 from string to integer by calling function parseInt(). This function will take an input of a string and conver it to its corresponding integer.
